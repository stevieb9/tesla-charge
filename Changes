Revision history for tesla-charge

1.02 UNREL
    - We now use WiFiManager; if we can't connect to a known wireless network,
      we'll start the controllers in AP mode ('TeslaInterface' and
      'TeslaController') so that a new wifi config can be uploaded
    - Added SSL support
    - Backend API URL is now configured through the WiFi configuration captive
      portal. ie, it's no longer hard-coded
    - Added token authentication (routes now are get/post); added 'tokens'
      section to config file
    - Added complete documentation
    - Add wifi config pins; if held HIGH on reboot, we'll enter config AP
      captive portal mode
    - Auth tokens now configurable through the captive portal
    - IP access now based on IP prefixes
